## SnapFil
SnapFil is a insentive based Filecoin content curation protocol. SnapFil is leveraging IPC for three specific reasons: 
 - Support of native Filecoin libraries to make protocol more secure and robust
 - High scalibility at lower cost
 - Compute is cheap

 - ```Setup IPC subnet, [follow](https://docs.ipc.space/quickstarts/deploy-a-subnet)```
 - ```Deploy the smart contract.sol file in the subnet, you can use metamask or hardhat for same```
 - ```Run the react app in curation-service directory to run UI and interactr with contaract```
